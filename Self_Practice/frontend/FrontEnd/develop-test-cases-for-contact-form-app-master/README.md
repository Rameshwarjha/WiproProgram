### Develop Test Cases for Contact Form

#### Context

Prime Solutions is an IT solutions provider company who has earned reputation in providing IT solutions in different business domains.​​​

Recently they have been approached to develop OneStopSolutions web application.​​​

Through this application the consumers can reach out to various services.​​​

One of the key component of the app is to build a contact book for all the service providers.​​​

Prime Solutions have approached Graffitti designers for a good UI design for managing contacts..​​​

The design is ready and now is functional.​​

##### Contact Form

Graffitti Designers have designed contact form that allows app users to provide inputs which captures inputs, validates and persists to server

The details are fetched and displayed in alphabetical order of name

#### Challenge

The organization now wants to ensure the behavior of the contact form is meeting the expectations​

As a developer you need to develop test code and test the code using Jasmine framework

#### Problem Statement

Develop test cases using Jasmine framework to test the behavior of contact form application ​

#### Instructions

1. Download and unzip the boilerplate code.  
2. Run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies required for automated testing.  
3. Open the boilerplate code in VSCode to develop the assignment solution.
4. Copy the solution code of Contact Form from previous week assignment on `Develop UI to Fetch and Display Contact Form Data` in `src` folder
5. Set up Jasmine to perform testing.
6. Provide the test code inside test spec file `contact-form-spec.js` in `test` folder.
7. Run the test code and ensure test code passes.
8. Run the command `npm run test` to test the existence of test suites and test methods.
9. Refactor the solution to ensure all test cases are passing.  
10. DO NOT MODIFY THE PROVIDED CODE, ELSE THIS MAY IMPACT THE TEST CODE EXECUTION.
11. Zip the solution code by selecting all the files and folders **excluding the node_modules folder** and give the name same as assignment name to the zipped file.
