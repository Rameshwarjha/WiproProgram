# steps for running rxjs code

# installing of rxjs
 * make a folder and go inside it 
 * "npm init" 
 * " npm install --save-dev rxjs "     // to install rxjs

 * make folder named src and make a file inside it named "testrx.js" or any other name we can have 

 * now this code will not work without "ES6" so we need to install "ES6" 

to make import work with nodejs we need to install ES6 module package using npm as shown below with command
 * " npm install --save-dev esm "

 //once package is installed we can execute the "testrx.js" 
 * command for execution of program 
  - "node -r esm testrx.js"   // here testrx.js is the file name it can be anything else also
